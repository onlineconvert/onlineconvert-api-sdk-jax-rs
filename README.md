# Online Convert API version 2 JAX-RS SDK

This SDK provides a code base to interact with the API version 2 for [Online-Convert.com](http://www.online-convert.com/).

Since the API version 2 follows the [Swagger specs](http://swagger.io/), this code has been generated using the [swagger code generator](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen), based on the current [API version 2 schema](https://api2.online-convert.com/schema).

## Overview
This server was generated using the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the 
[swagger-spec](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-core/wiki) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.  This 
is an example of building a swagger-enabled scalatra server.

This example uses the [scalatra](http://scalatra.org/) framework.  To learn how to make this your own, read here:

[README](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/tree/master/samples/server-generator/scalatra)
